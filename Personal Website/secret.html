          My name is Partho Biswas. I am a rising 8th grader at Nest+M. I live in Brooklyn, NYC. <br> <u>My passion for technology </u> <br> I started to code when I was in 3rd grade. I started off with block coding, and now I am learning professional code languages like HTML and CSS. I like to do coding because I believe that technology is part of human life now. It does have negative effects, but the positive ones can change the world for the good. I want to take advantage of having access to these materials to help others who go through tough things in their life. Outside of coding, I like to play basketball. I believe that the sport can relieve a lot of stress and ultimately make you more confident in yourself. With SHSAT season coming up, I am planning to apply to HSMSE
